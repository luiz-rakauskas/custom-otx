# custom-otx
Custom otx server already compiled (for Windows) fully functional.
I wrote a script that generates values for outfits and mounts, check "data\creaturescripts\scripts\others\Id generator.py"
By default all outfits, addons and mounts are unlocked for all players, check "login.lua" for more info.
